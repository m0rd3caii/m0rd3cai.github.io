title: Sandworm - Hack The Box
excerpt: "Sandworm is a medium-difficulty machine on the HTB platform. In order to access it, we need to obtain a PGP key to carry out an SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection). We'll need to make some maneuvers between user accounts, and then, to elevate privileges, we'll take advantage of the SUID permissions of firejail."
